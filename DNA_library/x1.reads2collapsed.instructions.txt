# Purpose: Collapses, quality filters and reports Unique Reads & Counts of one or multiple input.fastq.gz






# Usage 
#       x1.reads2collapsed.py <dir/to/data/input_basename_gz> <email> <gigs_requested> <hours_requested>

# Arguments
#       <email>                         user email to send alerts to
#       <gigs_requested>                gigabytes memory requested for server for computation
#       <hours_requested>               hours requested for server for computation

# Resource Recommendations
#	Gigs Requested
#		10 for 1-5 fastq.gz files
#		20 for 5-10
#		if memory failure persists, 30 G should be enough.
#		You will be charged for memory you request even if you don't use it. 
#	Hours Requested
#		< 5 hours. You are not charged for hours you don't use, so you can overshoot.  

# Inputs
#       <dir/to/data/input_basename>    1. location and input basename of files to be unzipped & concated
#                                       2. input_basename should not include any suffixes! (eg .fastq)
#                                       3. eg if inputs are (1) sample_1_A.fastq.gz and (2) sample_1_B_.fastq.gz, basename = sample_1

# Outputs
#       <input>_collapsed.fastq                         reads from all fastq.gz files
#       <input>_collapsed_filtered.fastq                <input>_collapsed.fastq quality filtered
#       <input>_collapsed_filtered_collapsed.txt        <input>_collapsed_filtered.fastq unique reads and counted (col1 = unique read, col2 = unique read co$

# Example:
#       Given files...
#               sample_1_A.fastq.gz
#               sample_1_B.fastq.gz
#
#       To unzip just one                    
#               > x1.reads2collapsed.py ./sample_1_A solvason@ucsd.edu 4 1
#
#       To unzip both into one file
#               > x1.reads2collapsed.py ./sample_1 solvason@ucsd.edu 4 1
